Important Questions Answers Wh y This Matters: 
What is the overall deductible ? In-Network:  $4,700 individual / $9,400
family. Generally, you must pay all the costs from providers  up to the deductible  amount
before this plan begins to pay. If you have other family members on the policy, the
overall family deductible  must be met before the plan begins to pay. 
Are there services covered before
you meet your deductible ? Yes. Preventive care , telemedicine
are covered before you meet your deductible
. This plan covers some items and services even if you haven’t yet met the deductible
amount. But a copayment  or coinsurance  may apply. For example, this plan covers
certain preventive services  without cost-sharing  and before you meet your deductible  .
See a list of covered preventive services  at https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/
#preventive-care-benefits/ . 
Are there other deductibles  for
specific services? There are no other specific deductibles
. You don't have to meet deductibles  for specific services.

this plan? For participating providers  $8,700
individual / $17,400 family The out-of-pocket limit  is the most you could pay in a year for covered services. If

be met. 
What is not included in the out-of-
pocket limit ? Premiums , balance-billing  charges,
and health care this plan doesn't
cover. Even though you pay these expenses, they don't count toward the out-of-pocket limit . 
Will you pay less if you use a network provider
? Yes. See www.EmblemHealth.com  or
call 1-800-447-8255 for a list ofparticipating providers
.This plan uses a provider  network . You will pay less if you use a provider  in the plan’s  
network . You will pay the most if you use a non-participating provider , and you might
receive a bill from a provider  for the difference between the provider’s  charge and what
your plan pays ( balance billing ). Be aware, your network provider  might use an out-of-
network provider  for some services (such as lab work). Check with your provider
before you get services.
Do you need a referral  to see a
specialist ? Yes This plan will pay some or all of the costs to see a specialist  for covered services, but
only if you have a referral  before you see the specialist .
